Price: ${price} USDT


How to pay in USDT:

1️⃣ It is important to copy and transfer exactly the amount indicated on the payment page, with all numbers after the decimal point - necessary for automatic payment processing!

2️⃣ If you do not have a crypto wallet, you can choose a profitable exchange method from your card / account here:
bestchange.ru
Exchange ONLY for USDT on the network selected on the payment page. If you have chosen the Solana network, it does not mean that only SOL can be translated in it 😄

3️⃣ The speed of the transaction depends on the network and its load. It usually takes up to 5 minutes, after which you can check your balance.'
